# biosim-rust
## What?

This is a (in-progess) rust implementation of [davidmiller/biosim4](https://github.com/davidrmiller/biosim4).

## Why?

I found C++ really unsightly and bloated. I also find the code and topic very interesting, so this is a way to learn more about the implementation while avoiding C++.
